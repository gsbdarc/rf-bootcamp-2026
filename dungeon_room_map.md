# DARC Dungeon — Room Map & Learning Objectives

**Grimoire file format:** `fireball_fire_3_offensive_meteor.spell`
`name_element_tier_type_mastery.spell`
Elements: fire / ice / lightning / earth / wind
Types: offensive / defensive / utility / healing

Each hands-on block is a **dungeon room**. Every room has:
- 🗡️ **Main quest** — required, everyone does this
- 📦 **Chests** — finish early? go deeper on the same skill, unlock a named weapon
- 🧠 **Skills learned** — what the researcher takes away (the learning objective)
- 🔑 **Boss Gates** — floor exits, require all main quests on that floor

Weapons are cumulative: a skill unlocked in Day 1 pays off in Day 3 and beyond.

## Open decisions

1. **Grimoire file attributes** — confirm: `name_element_tier_type_mastery.spell` with elements fire/ice/lightning/earth/wind?
2. **Quest Log card** — printed card (mark off rooms + chests as you go) or digital tracker on the course site?
3. **Chest instructions** — written walkthrough on the site, or just a one-line prompt and students figure it out (Python Challenge style)?
4. **Day 4 pacing** — privacy + agents + MCP is discussion-heavy; is that okay after 3 hands-on days, or should one of the three be trimmed?
