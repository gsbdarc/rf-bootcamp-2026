# The Venv Forge

<div data-room-id="d2-venv-forge"></div>

*Deep in the Alchemist's Lab, the forge blazes with a fierce, contained light. Every serious project demands its own crucible — a sealed vessel where dependencies are bound to one purpose and one purpose only. Pour the wrong reagent into the wrong crucible and the contamination cascades, poisoning every experiment downstream. The Forge was built to stop that. Step inside, heat your crucible, and pour your ingredients with precision. One project. One environment. No exceptions.*

## 🗡️ Main Quest

{: .important }
> **Quest:** Create a Python virtual environment on the Yens, activate it, install packages, and connect it to JupyterHub as a named kernel.

---

### Step 1 — Create a Working Directory and Venv (Exercise 3)

In your **Jupyter terminal** (or SSH terminal):

```bash
mkdir day2
cd day2
```

Create the virtual environment using the system Python:

```bash
/usr/bin/python3 -m venv venv
```

Using `/usr/bin/python3` explicitly picks the base system Python, not whatever module might be loaded. This creates a `venv/` folder inside your `day2/` directory.

Check what's in your path now:

```bash
echo $PATH
which python3
```

---

### Step 2 — Activate and Explore the PATH Change

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your prompt now shows `(venv)` — you're inside the environment. Check what changed:

```bash
echo $PATH          # venv/bin is now at the front
which python3       # now points inside venv/
```

Try deactivating and checking again:

```bash
deactivate
which python3       # back to system python
echo $PATH
```

Reactivate:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

{: .note }
> 💡 The `venv/bin/activate` script works by prepending `venv/bin/` to your `$PATH` — the same mechanism as `module load`. Deactivating removes it.

---

### Step 3 — Install Packages

With the venv active, install the packages you'll need for Day 2:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv ipykernel openai pydantic
```

These packages are installed only inside this venv — not for anyone else on the cluster.

Verify by testing in the venv terminal:

```bash
python3 -c "import dotenv; print('dotenv ok')"
```

Now deactivate and try the same import:

```bash
deactivate
python3 -c "import dotenv"    # should fail — not installed in system python
```

Reactivate when done testing.

---

### Step 4 — Register as a Jupyter Kernel

With the venv active, register it as a kernel JupyterHub can use:

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=bootcamp-2026 --display-name "Bootcamp 2026"
```

Now go to JupyterHub:
- Open your `day2/` folder in the file browser
- Create a new notebook
- Select **"Bootcamp 2026"** as the kernel from the kernel menu

In the notebook, confirm the environment is active:

```python
import dotenv
print("dotenv is available!")
```

If this runs without error, your venv is correctly connected.

{: .note }
> 💡 Never commit the `venv/` directory to git — it's hundreds of megabytes of installed packages. Add it to `.gitignore`:
> ```bash
> echo "venv/" >> ~/rf-bootcamp-2026/.gitignore
> ```

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- A virtual environment is an isolated Python installation — packages installed in one venv don't affect any other project
- `source venv/bin/activate` prepends `venv/bin/` to `$PATH`, making the venv's Python the first match
- JupyterHub kernels are just named Python environments — you can have one per project
- Never commit `venv/` to git — it's too large and machine-specific
