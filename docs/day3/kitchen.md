# The Kitchen

<div data-room-id="d3-kitchen"></div>

*Steam hangs in the air. Seventeen other researchers are already in here — one has a slow roast that's been in the oven for six hours, two more are fighting over the last open burner, and somewhere in the back a job has been queued so long it's practically fossilized. This is the Yens cluster at peak hours, rendered in cast iron and fire. Watch it breathe before you even think about striking a match. Once you see the chaos, SLURM stops being bureaucracy and starts being salvation.*

## 🗡️ Main Quest

Before you touch a single `sbatch` flag, you need to see the beast with your own eyes.

{: .important }
> **Quest:** Watch the Yens live — see resource contention in real time, then understand the kitchen analogy for SLURM.

This is a 30-minute class participation block. Follow along on the projector — call out what you see.

**Step 1 — See who's using the Yens right now:**

```bash
userload          # shows current CPU/memory usage per user across all Yen servers
htop              # interactive process viewer — press q to quit
```

Look at `userload`. Every row is a researcher. Some are using thousands of CPU-hours. Now imagine you try to run a 32-core job from the command line — you'd be competing with all of them for the same shared hardware.

{: .note }
> **Class discussion:** What do you notice about CPU usage? Who's using the most? What do you think happens if everyone runs intensive jobs directly on the shared interactive Yens at the same time?

**Step 2 — The kitchen analogy:**

First, the hardware. A computer is just a kitchen:

```

```

The Yens is just a much bigger, shared kitchen:

  Many more burners · shared with all researchers · free

  Cloud (AWS/GCP) — Rented kitchen: all yours, infinite, costs $$
```

**The tricky part:** when you write a script, you don't know in advance how many burners it needs, how much fridge space, or how many trips to the store. You have to measure first — that's what [The Scales](../scales/) room is for.

**The SLURM problem:** the Yens kitchen is shared. If everyone just walks in and starts cooking, chaos. That's SLURM's job:

```
  Without SLURM                         With SLURM (head chef)
  ───────────────────────────           ────────────────────────────────────

  Everyone runs jobs on the shared      You submit a job script (recipe)
  interactive Yens — competing for      Head chef reads your #SBATCH requests
  the same burners, no isolation,       Assigns you a dedicated station
  random failures                       (compute node — yours alone)
                                        You come back when it's done
```

| Kitchen              | Yens / SLURM                        |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Head chef            | SLURM scheduler                     |
| Station (stove)      | Compute node                        |
| Order ticket         | Job script (`sbatch`)               |
| Tickets on the rail  | Job queue (`squeue`)                |
| Warehouse            | Shared storage (`/scratch`)         |
| Recipe               | Your Python/R/shell script          |
| Dietary restriction  | `#SBATCH` resource request          |

{: .note }
> **Class discussion:** What questions do you have about how SLURM assigns resources? What happens if you ask for too much? Too little?

You don't walk into the kitchen and start cooking. You hand your recipe to the head chef (`sbatch`), specify what burners and fridge space you need (`#SBATCH` directives), and come back when the meal is done.

**Step 3 — Why big jobs go through SLURM:**

```bash
# Don't run a long intensive job directly on a shared Yen — you're sharing it with everyone
# python my_big_script.py   ← wrong for big jobs
# Instead, use sbatch (we'll get there in The Foreman's Desk)
```

The interactive Yens are for editing, exploring, and short tasks — not pegging 256 cores for hours.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- You can read live resource contention on the Yens and know exactly who is eating the cluster's lunch
- You can map every piece of SLURM vocabulary to a kitchen equivalent — scheduler, queue, compute node, and all
- You can distinguish the shared interactive Yens from a dedicated SLURM compute node — and know when each is appropriate
- You know that running heavy long jobs directly on a shared Yen is inconsiderate to every other researcher on the cluster — and you will never do it
