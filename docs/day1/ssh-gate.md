# The SSH Gate

<div data-room-id="d1-ssh-gate"></div>

*A crackling arc of electricity splits the gatehouse air, smelling of ozone and possibility. The rune carved above it reads: `ssh`. Touch the wrong stone and nothing stirs — touch the right one and a door tears open three thousand miles away, inside a machine humming in a Stanford data center. One command. A cryptographic handshake older than your laptop. And suddenly, you are there.*

## 🖊️ Why Use a Server at All?

Your laptop is fine for writing code and running small tests. But research computing regularly runs into walls that a laptop cannot break through:

| Situation | What happens on a laptop | What happens on the Yens |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Dataset is 80 GB | Out of memory, script crashes | Loads fine — 250 GB–3 TB RAM per node |
| Analysis takes 12 hours | Laptop sleeps, WiFi drops, run dies | Job keeps running — always on, always connected |
| Need to run 100 jobs in parallel | One at a time, ties up your machine | Submit all 100 at once via the scheduler |
| Data is restricted (IRB, NDA) | Must stay on Stanford systems | Yens are Stanford-managed infrastructure |
| Collaborating with your PI | "Can you send me the data?" | PI already has access to `/yen/projects/` |

The Yens are available to all researchers at GSB — faculty, PhD students, and pre-docs alike. Today we learn how to use them effectively.

> *"My regression on the full sample took 14 hours. My laptop died at hour 6. I lost everything. Two days later I reran it on the Yens and went to sleep. It finished while I was gone."* — Ben

## 🖊️ What Is a Remote Server?

Your laptop is powerful but limited: one machine, one location, and it has to be open and plugged in for work to run. A **remote server** is a computer you connect to over the network — it's always on, more powerful than your laptop, and your work keeps running after you close the lid.

**What are the Yens?**

The Yens are a 17-node shared research computing cluster: 5 interactive nodes you SSH into directly, and 12 nodes accessible only through the SLURM scheduler (Day 3). All 17 nodes share the same file system — a file you write on yen1 is instantly visible on every other node.

`ssh` opens an encrypted tunnel: you type locally, commands execute remotely, output streams back to your screen. The interactive Yens are shared — per-user CPU and RAM limits are enforced automatically. See the [current limits](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_policies/user_limits/) for details. For heavier jobs, the SLURM scheduler (Day 3) gives you dedicated compute nodes.

**What's inside a Yen server:**

![Server hardware diagram showing CPU, cores, and RAM — Yen1 has 256 cores]({{ "/assets/images/server-hardware-cpu-ram.png" | relative_url }})

The **CPU** is the processor chip. **Cores** are the individual workers inside it — each core runs instructions independently, which is what makes parallel work possible. **RAM** holds the data the CPU is actively using. The Yen servers vary in size — see the [current specs on RCPedia](https://rcpedia.stanford.edu/_getting_started/yen-servers/#overview-of-the-yen-computing-infrastructure) for details.

## 🗡️ Main Quest

You are about to set foot on the Yens for the first time. Type carefully, breathe normally — the cluster is waiting for you.

{: .important }
> **Quest:** Connect to the Yens cluster over SSH, identify which interactive Yen you landed on, and read the login banner.

**Connect:**
```bash
ssh SUNetID@yen.stanford.edu
```

Replace `SUNetID` with your actual Stanford username (e.g. `jsmith`). Once you're logged in, the shell variable `$USER` expands to your username automatically — so commands you run *on the Yens* will use `$USER` instead of the literal placeholder. When prompted for your password, type your Stanford password (nothing will appear — that's normal). You will be prompted for Duo two-factor authentication.

**Identify your node:**
```bash
hostname      # e.g. yen1, yen2, yen3, yen4, or yen5
whoami        # confirm you're logged in as yourself
```

{: .note }
> The Yens (yen1–yen5) are shared interactive compute servers. You land on whichever one the load balancer picks. They're powerful, but shared — read the login banner when you connect, it describes current usage policies.

**Read the banner, then look around:**
```bash
ls ~                              # your home directory on the Yens
pwd                               # /home/users/SUNetID
ls /scratch/shared/               # shared scratch — you will create your own folder here later
ls /yen/projects/                 # shared project storage
```
