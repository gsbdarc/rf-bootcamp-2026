# The Scroll Transfer

<div data-room-id="d1-scroll-transfer"></div>

*Deep in the courier's chamber, a pneumatic tube pierces the dungeon wall — the only passage between your world and the cluster's vast vaults. Every scroll you send hurtles through an encrypted tunnel and lands exactly where you aim it. On the Yens, that tube has a name: `scp`, secure copy. It rides the same SSH connection you already wield, and it obeys a simple, ruthless law — one copy exists, wherever you choose to put it.*

## 🗡️ Main Quest

Your grimoire is sorted, your spells are ready — now send them into the cluster's depths where real compute awaits.

{: .important }
> **Quest:** Transfer your sorted grimoire directory from your laptop to your Yens scratch space using `scp`.

Run this from your **laptop** (not on the Yens — open a new local terminal tab):

```bash
scp -r ~/grimoire/ SUNetID@yen.stanford.edu:/scratch/shared/SUNetID/grimoire/
```

- `-r` means recursive — copies the whole directory tree
- The destination path is `remote_host:remote_path`

**Verify the transfer on the Yens:**
```bash
# SSH back onto the Yens (or use the tab that's already open)
ls /scratch/shared/SUNetID/grimoire/fire/    # should show your fire spells
```

{: .note }
> 💡 The Yens use a **shared file system** — every Yen server (yen1–yen5) sees the same `/home` and `/scratch`. You copy once and the file is everywhere on the cluster simultaneously. No need to copy again if you switch nodes.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- You can now beam entire directory trees from your laptop into the cluster with a single `scp` command
- You know the Yens' shared file system means one copy lands everywhere — no node-by-node shuffling required
