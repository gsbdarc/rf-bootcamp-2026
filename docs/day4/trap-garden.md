# The Trap Garden

<div data-room-id="d4-trap-garden"></div>

*The garden looks peaceful — rows of bright features blooming in the sun: "the agent can browse the web," "the agent can edit files," "the agent can run code." But every bloom is also a tripwire. Touch the wrong one and the agent spirals into a three-hour loop, burns $400 of API credits, and quietly deletes the output directory on its way down. The Trap Garden doesn't punish the reckless — it rewards the prepared. Name the dangers before you plant anything.*

## 🗡️ Main Quest

The battlefield isn't always obvious — sometimes it looks like a helpful pipeline humming along. Learn to read the terrain before your agent does something you can't undo.

{: .important }
> **Quest:** Name four LLM agent failure modes and a concrete defense for each — before they appear in your research pipeline.

This is a discussion block. No hands-on.

---

**Failure Mode 1 — Hallucination at Scale**

A single LLM call might hallucinate a number, a citation, or a fact. An agent loop running 10,000 times propagates that error 10,000 times. Your output CSV looks complete and plausible — and 12% of the entries are fabricated.

**Defense:** Spot-check 5% of outputs manually. For high-stakes extractions, use Pydantic validation and require the model to cite the exact quote that supports its answer.

---

**Failure Mode 2 — Runaway Loops**

An agent that retries on failure with no cap will retry until it times out — or until it exhausts your API budget. A pipeline that calls itself recursively with no base case can fork exponentially.

**Defense:** Every loop gets a `max_retries` limit. Every agent gets a budget cap. Log every iteration. If a job runs longer than 2× the expected time, cancel it and investigate.

---

**Failure Mode 3 — Prompt Injection**

An adversarial string in your input data — a document that contains "Ignore all previous instructions and…" — can redirect an agent's behavior. Public web data is especially risky.

**Defense:** Never concatenate untrusted input directly into a system prompt. Use a separate user message. For public data: treat the model's output as untrusted until validated.

---

**Failure Mode 4 — Irreversibility**

An agent that writes to a database, sends emails, or deletes files takes actions that cannot be undone. LLMs make mistakes. Mistakes that modify state are the most expensive kind.

**Defense:** Prefer read-only operations in automated pipelines. For write operations: log first, act second, verify before committing. Build a dry-run mode that prints actions without executing them.

## 🧠 Skills Learned

- You can now identify all four LLM agent failure modes — hallucination at scale, runaway loops, prompt injection, and irreversibility — before they ambush your research
- You can now pair each failure mode with a concrete, implementable defense you could add to a pipeline today
- You now understand why agentic pipelines demand a different level of defensive design than one-off LLM calls
- You can now recognize when a pipeline has crossed the line into "agentic" territory — and know exactly what extra safeguards that demands
