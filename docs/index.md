# The DARC Dungeon

*You stand at the entrance of an ancient tower. Four floors rise above you, each sealed with an Archmage's crest. Somewhere inside, the secrets of computational research await — CLI runes carved into stone walls, SLURM forges humming in the depths, GPU engines blazing on the highest floor.*

> **Day 1 — Do this first**
>
> 1. **Fork this repo** — click **Fork** in the top-right corner of the [GitHub page](https://github.com/gsbdarc/rf-bootcamp-2026) to create your own copy
> 2. **Enable GitHub Pages** on your fork: Settings → Pages → Source → **GitHub Actions** → Save
> 3. **Open your personal dungeon site:** `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/rf-bootcamp-2026/`
>
> Your site is your quest log for the entire course. Keep it open — every room, exercise, and leaderboard submission happens here.

**How the dungeon works**

Each floor corresponds to one day of the bootcamp. Every floor has **rooms** — enter each room, complete the **Main Quest**, and move to the next.

Finished early? Look for **Side Quests** — optional deeper challenges that unlock a named **Weapon** (a skill you carry for the rest of the course). Weapons compound: what you earn in Day 1 pays off in Day 3.

Each floor ends with a **Boss Gate**: a capstone challenge you submit by committing your work to your fork on GitHub. Push your commit → the grader runs → the next floor unlocks on your personal site.

Every completed quest adds to your **Quest Log** (shown in the widget, bottom-left). Completing all main quests on each floor is enough to pass the Boss Gate and advance. Side quests push your level higher — that is what separates the top of the leaderboard. The more side quests you finish, the higher your rank.

*The gate is open. The torch is lit. Whatever waits inside — the shell that answers in milliseconds, the cluster that never sleeps, the model you'll summon from bare silicon — it is yours to claim.*

*Good luck, adventurer. The dungeon awaits.*
